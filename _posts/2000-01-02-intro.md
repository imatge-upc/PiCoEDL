*We tackle embodied visual navigation in a task-agnostic set-up by putting the focus on the unsupervised discovery of skills (or options) that provide a good coverage of states. Our approach intersects with empowerment: we address the reward-free skill discovery and learning tasks to discover "what" can be done in an environment and "how". For this reason, we adopt the existing Explore, Discover and Learn (EDL) [Campos, ICML 2020] paradigm, tested only in toy example mazes, and extend it to pixel-based state representations available for embodied AI agents. *
